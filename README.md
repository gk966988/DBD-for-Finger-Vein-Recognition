# DBD-for-Finger-Vein-Recognition
This project is an algorithm for reproducing the paper《Discriminative Binary Descriptor for Finger Vein Recognition》，you can get the paper by https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240902
the register images and test images 
Registration images and test images should be in folders "data/Register" and "data/TestImage", but it have been deleted for privacy.
But I've saved the registered finger vein images and label as train.mat and saved the test finger vein images and label as test.mat by
run file Loda_data.m.
Now, you can run train.m get the result.
